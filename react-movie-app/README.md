# Movie API and Icons Integration - README

This repository contains a project that integrates the OMDB Movie API and custom icons from Icons8. It's built using React and utilizes various libraries for smooth development and implementation. Below you'll find details about the API, icons, libraries used, a development tutorial reference, and ways to connect with the project creator.

## Movie API Details and Documentation

For detailed information about the OMDB Movie API and its usage, please visit [OMDB API Documentation](https://www.omdbapi.com/). This API provides data related to movies, including details like title, plot, cast, ratings, and more. It's a valuable resource for any project related to movies and entertainment.

## Icons

Icons for this project were sourced from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons/set/home). Icons8 offers a wide range of icons for various purposes, and in this project, these icons contribute to the visual aspects of the user interface.

## Libraries Used

The project is built using the following libraries:

- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/): A popular CSS-in-JS library that enhances the styling of React components by allowing you to write actual CSS code within your JavaScript code.
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/): A promise-based HTTP client that simplifies making HTTP requests from the browser.
- [react-scripts](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html): A set of scripts and configuration used by Create React App for building and running React applications.

## Development Documentation

During the development of this project, the tutorial provided by FreeCodeCamp was referred to. You can find the tutorial here: [React Movie App Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-movie-app-tutorial/). This resource offers step-by-step guidance on building a movie app using React, making it a valuable reference for understanding the development process.
